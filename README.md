# Pong_a3c

We use the A3C algorithm to play pong. Using the different network structure. 
[only_cnn_worker_8] only uses the single frame to control by CNN; 
[cnn_lstm_worker_8] inputs 4 continue frames into cnn+lstm network structure;
[multi_worker] and [single_worker_debug] are debug code;
We show the final video pong.MP4
