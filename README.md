# Pong_a3c

We use the A3C algorithm to play pong. Using the different network structure. 
[a3c_worker_8_cnn] only uses the single frame to control by CNN; 
[a3c_worker_8_lstm] inputs 4 continue frames into cnn+lstm network structure;
[multi_work] and [single_worker_debug] are debug code;
We show the final video pong.MP4
